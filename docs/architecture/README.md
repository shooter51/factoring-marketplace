# System Architecture

## Overview
The Factoring Marketplace Platform is a multi-tenant application built on AWS serverless architecture, connecting Carriers with Factoring Companies.

## Infrastructure Components

### Frontend
- React Single Page Application (SPA)
- Hosted on AWS CloudFront
- Static assets stored in S3
- Authentication via AWS Cognito
- Real-time updates via WebSocket API

### Backend
- C# AWS Lambda Functions
- API Gateway for RESTful endpoints
- Cognito User Pools for authentication
- SNS for notifications
- PostgreSQL RDS for data storage
- S3 for document storage

## Authentication & Authorization

### User Types
1. Carrier
2. Factor
3. System Administrator

### Authentication Flow
1. User authenticates via Cognito
2. JWT tokens issued for API authorization
3. Role-based access control implemented

- CloudFront edge locations for global access
- S3 for unlimited document storage

## Monitoring & Logging
- CloudWatch for metrics and logging
- X-Ray for request tracing
- Custom dashboards for business metrics
- Automated alerting system

## Disaster Recovery
- Multi-AZ RDS deployment
- Regular automated backups
- Point-in-time recovery capability
